# Alpaca Emblem 

## Project CC3002-2 2019

Alpaca Emblem is a strategy's game by shifts with different types of units that have strengths and weaknesses between them. In this repository we'll save all the advance in the building of the App.

This project consists in a 3-stage work: **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** 

#### Model - "Homework 1"

In the first project's stage it will build all the necessary entities that will be useful in the structure base of the project and all the interactions possible between those entities. The entities are the elements that compose the game.

#### View - "Homework 2"

The second project's stage it will build a graphic interface for the game such that can reply to input of a user and display all the game's relevant information in the screen. 

#### Controller - "Homework 3"

This stage will use as logic connection between the *view and the model*. The controller must execute all the operations that a gamer would want to do, that return the messages necessaries to each object of the model and that save the information more important of the game's state in all moment.
